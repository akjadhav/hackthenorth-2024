A man is sitting in a yellow room, waiting for luggage to be unloaded from his suitcase. His luggage is placed directly in front of him, taking up both his immediate surroundings, and the rest of the room. Also, there is a bench up against the wall near the sitting area. A chair can also be seen at the far end of the room. One additional person is present in the room, standing to the right of the man. The overall atmosphere seems to be a waiting or relaxing area for the man and the person standing near him.
