The image displays a man sitting on a chair in a public space like a hotel or airport lobby, with a vacant look on his face. There are other chairs scattered throughout the room, and there are also some backpacks and suitcases nearby. One backpack is situated next to the man in the chair, while two others are placed further away from him. A suitcase can be seen close to the right of the frame and another close to the left side of the frame, placing it next to the man's chair.


A few personal items are also present in the scene, such as a handbag, two bottles, and a computer mouse. The handbag is placed in the lower-middle area of the space, while the bottles are situated on both the left and right sides of the frame, and the computer mouse can be found on the right side of the man's chair.
