The man is sitting on a chair in a room with luggage scattered around him. There are multiple bags on the ground and a handbag close to him, indicating that he is either arriving or departing from a location. One nearby suitcase also seems to be taking up a large portion of the room. Despite the disarray, the man seems to be in a comfortable setting with various chairs and a clock on the wall above his head.
