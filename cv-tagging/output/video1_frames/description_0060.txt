The image features a man sitting in an airport waiting area with his shirt off. He is holding a bottle and appears to be waiting for his luggage. Several chairs are placed throughout the room, with one near the man and others a little further away. Two suitcases are visible in the scene, one behind the man and the other closer to the right side.


Utensils such as a knife, scissors, and a spoon are placed nearby on a surface. Additionally, there are three books and a television on the left side of the room.
