The image shows a young man sitting on a chair in an emptily decorated room, surrounded by a pair of chairs and suitcases. There is a purple suitcase in front of the man, with another larger green suitcase positioned further from him. An additional chair is located on the left side of the room, closer to another man who is distant from the main chair on which the man is sitting. 


Two bottles are present in the scene, placed at a distance from the man, aligning upwards vertically. A cell phone can be found nearby. A handbag and an umbrella are also on the scene. The man's chair is positioned both inside and outside of the camera. The larger of the two suitcases is located at a distance from the main blue suitcase.


Information displayed on the left side of the image appears to indicate a yellow tone, while the right side has an icy blue tone, complete with grey, brown, yellow, and blue. 


There is no notable presence of other people, giving a calm and relaxed atmosphere to the room. 


Notably, the man's head appears much larger than his torso, while the rest of the room remains a dull white color, creating a lighter atmosphere and relying on outlines for depth and structure. The suitcase in the foreground being visually overwhelming results from the perception of two colors, with a stunning change of size on the guy's head compared to the blue suitcase.


In summary, the room contains a chair, a man, another person, an umbrella, and a handbag. There is a cake sitting next to a body sitting on the chair.
