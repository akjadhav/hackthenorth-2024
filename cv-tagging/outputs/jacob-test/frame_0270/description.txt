The scene in the image showcases a person seated in a chair, accompanied by multiple objects in the room. A number of chairs are positioned both near the man and in the background. There are several suitcases scattered throughout the room, some on the left, others in the middle and a few on the right side of the image. Additionally, a backpack is resting on one of the chairs, and a handbag is located at the very far right side of the image.


The man in the room is wearing a red shirt and drinking water directly from its bottle. The room displays a mix of furniture, highlighting the various belongings within it. The person, seated carefully in a red chair, appears to be the main subject, situated towards the center of the frame. Other objects, like a backpack on the floor at a lower position and a bottle to his side, further detail the items within the room.
