In the foreground, a man is sitting in a chair in a room with a yellow wall. Behind the man, there's a suitcase, a backpack, and a handbag. The white chair the man is sitting on is in front of another, smaller chair, and both chairs are positioned between a suitcase and a backpack. The man appears to be interacting with the luggage, possibly waiting for it to be loaded to make his journey more comfortable.


In total, there are five suitcases visible in the scene, with only the largest one lying on the ground near the man. The remaining four are spread out, ranging farther from the man in depth. The man himself is sitting in between these four suitcases in the room.
