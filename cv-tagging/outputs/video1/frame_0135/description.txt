The image captures a man sitting in a chair in a brightly lit room. Various objects can be seen throughout, with a particularly large number of suitcases and chairs. There is also a TV on the wall in the background. The man appears relaxed and not in distress.


Amongst various objects in the scene, the suitcases are predominantly located in front of the man and represent one of the primary focal points of the room. Multiple chairs are placed throughout the scene, with one occupying the bottom left section, with a chair in the top right of the room, and two more placed next to the man in the scene, more specifically- another behind the man and another to his right. Two remote controls visible in the image but both located on a wall – one slightly below and behind the man and another further away in the room.
