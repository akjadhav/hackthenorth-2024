The scene takes place in what appears to be a sitting area in an airport terminal, as inferred by the presence of a suitcase, a chair, and a handbag. In the image, a man is sitting on a white chair, holding a bottle. Other objects found in the image include a suitcase, another chair, a backpack, and a handbag. There is also a couch in the background.


Outlining the room with chair and handbag, and with the backpack and couch at a slight distance, the room likely has a sense of depth and spatial relationships as the man is seated in the foreground. The handbag is to the right and close to the man, while the chair he is sitting on has a depth of 0.12.


Another chair is present, relatively further back in the scene, and closer to a corner at a depth of 0.75. A suitcase can be seen nearby, ranging from 0.45 to more than 0.45 in depth, indicating that the suitcase is close to the man and his chair.


In the background, a backpack is located towards the left and close to the middle of the floor. A couch is visible in the section where the couch and the man. In this area, the couch has a depth of 0.12. The objects' relative positions and depths create an interesting scene of a man sitting in the foreground.
