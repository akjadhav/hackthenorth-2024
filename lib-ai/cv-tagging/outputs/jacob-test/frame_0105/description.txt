The image depicts a man in a yellow living room with three different luggages visible: a handbag positioned towards the center, a suitcase to the right, and a backpack sitting further back. The man sits on the left side of the room with the luggage around. A bottle can be seen nearby on a surface. 


The room gives off a warm ambiance with yellow as the main color. Multiple chairs are present, with one located on the left side closer to the suitcase, two further in the back from left to right, and the main chair he is sitting on. 


Numerating the chairs from the left will have you focus on the man and the luggage. On the right, the next chair is sitting in the room towards the right side, with two chairs in the middle, including the closest to the camera.


One backpack is seen on the right, and various suitcases and bags are displayed in the main living room area - this is at the close, middle, and far from the room are the three rooms. The depth of the scene shows the room is sparse and quite an unoccupied space. The camera's focus is on the four main areas of the room; both the main room and its boundaries. Squinting into these four areas, one could perceive the depth of the living room as quite deep overall.
