    "a2cecde5": "A person standing with moderate confidence of detection. Given the depth value, they are likely positioned towards the back of the visible space. Details are not clear due to the moderate confidence level but the individual appears to be upright and facing the camera.",
    "36f35eec": "Another person with a lower confidence of detection. Similar to the first, this person is possibly at the back of the scene due to the identical depth, standing and potentially facing the camera.",
    "85922d3f": "A chair with the lowest confidence of detection, positioned slightly in front of the two people in the scene based on its depth value. The chair appears to be of a standard four-legged design and is unoccupied."

  "scene_analysis": {
    "composition": "The scene is an interior space with distinct tiling on the floor, various furnishings, and a possible counter or service area to the left. People and chairs are positioned within this setting, suggesting a public or communal area like a cafe or waiting room.",
    "lighting_and_colors": "The lighting appears to be artificial and bright, likely from indoor fixtures. Colors are varied, with dominant grays from the tiled floor and hints of red from the counter area. Reflections on the right side suggest a glass barrier or window.",
    "atmosphere": "The atmosphere is that of a typical indoor public space during daytime, with a sense of stillness due to the lack of visible movement and activity in the captured moment.",
    "text_and_signage": "There is no discernible text or signage in the image that is legible or contextually significant."
