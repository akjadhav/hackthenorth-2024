The image portrays a white building, where a man and a woman are walking through a white hall lined with rectangles of different sizes. Throughout the hallway, there are chairs and benches lined up between the walls. A person has a lower camera view, and an upper camera view, with "The floor!" anointed under one of the views. The woman and the man are walking through the hallway, presumably at a school.

             

      

A suitcase is visible, though its location isn't entirely clear. The suitcase appears to have a certain level of confidence and depth, with an overall confidence score of 0.3. The floor appears on at least one of the camera views, possibly in the white building with the hallway, and is most likely in both the main view and the hallway view.


In the main view, the woman is standing in the background with her face pixelated out. The view gives them a red square on both sides, as well as various benches that are in the hallway.


In this hallway picture, the woman and the man walking together are perceived smaller. The main white building with the hallway is close in size to both the man and the woman.


In the hall, the square square is very real and white. Moreover, a backpack is noticeable with the camera on it. There's also a chair located in the hallway.


The woman and the man, captured in close-up, are both under the camera's view. Their positions have moderate confidence, and they are partly visible. The large white wall with photos is well-defined along with the tall white background and the hallway, also contributing to the white building's size. The hall is a typical educational environment.
