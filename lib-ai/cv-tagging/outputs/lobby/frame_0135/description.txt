This is a spacious room with a large number of students present, captured in front of one of the walls. There is a woman, standing in the foreground, who appears to be playing a game of digital tag. Another person is standing to her left, while a different individual is a bit further away, both in front of others present in the room.


The room is lined with windows but seems mostly empty all around, with no one close in the right-hand side of the image. In this open place, there's a backpack, a chair, a bench and, in addition to the woman with a cell phone staring at her digital tag marker, all belonging to the same room.
