The image is a close-up of a person sitting in a room with multiple objects visible around them. A red chair is placed near them, accompanied by a suitcase and a backpack. The man is sitting in the middle of a yellow room. Sitting atop the chair is an open bottle, possibly containing water.


In addition to these objects, there are two chairs (one red the other brown), located ahead of the person seated, and the man in between these two. Multiple suitcases and backpacks can be seen all around, and a cup can also be spotted near the middle of the image, away from the man.


In terms of the objects' depth, the man is closest to the yellow room, while the other objects—including the chairs and suitcases—are either in the room or closer to the background, with the luggage cart placed closely to the man, and the suitcases surrounding him depixed over it. Overall, the room has a sense of compactness.
