    "composition": "The scene appears to be an indoor setting, possibly a waiting area or a lobby. A person is centrally positioned, with various luggage items in the fore and background.",
    "lighting_and_colors": "The room features fluorescent lighting, creating a brightly lit scene with neutral colors such as beige walls. The red shirt of the person adds a splash of color to the otherwise muted tones.",

    "text_and_signage": "No visible text or signage that provides additional context to the scene, aside from a possible brand watermark 'tapo' at the bottom left."
