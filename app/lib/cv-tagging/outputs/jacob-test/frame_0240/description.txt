The image shows a living room with a male sitting in a chair, likely on cellphone, in a vlogging context. There are two suitcases located on the floor and a backpack placed nearby. The depth of the image shows the depth values are from the front left corner to the right rear corner of the suitcase. The chair on which the man is sitting sits closest to you, while the suitcases on the floor make up the rest of the room. A handbag on the left side of the room complements the scene. 


The man in the vlog is seated in an office chair towards the center of the room. Meanwhile, a smaller man looking away from you within the room sits on a chair on the right side of the living room. Additionally, another two objects show up closer to the chair he occupies, further underscoring the impression of the room's interior environment.


Some additional details: The room features a small TV in the background centrally above the man, and the large suitcase on the floor is closest to you amongst the two suitcases. The empty chair, front right corner, seemingly looks unoccupied by another person or visible luggage, giving the room a spacious and uncluttered appearance.
