The image captures a large hallway inside of a building where several people are visible, including one person near the center of the scene, another one closer to the right side of the image, and the third one further back. There is additional space on the left side with two small figures.


There are multiple benches placed throughout the area; one located in the center and two others is situated further back along the hallway. In the foreground of the image, a man is present, which is the one with his back facing you. He is bending slightly inward and is wearing a backpack.


The monitor screen is located at the right side, showing different screens apart from the main one and seemingly enhancing the environment. The area all around is filled with people, including an observation room with a woman, another individual, and that of a person holding luggage placed in the foreground. There is a man in the back with a backpack, and another man with a backpack closer to the front. The other two figures are situated towards the left. 


This scene appears to be monitored, perhaps from an observation room or a security desk, as the building entrance is close by on the left, featuring screens showing the interior of the building.
