There are two bags visible in the scene, one in the foreground and the other in the middle of the area. 


A backpack is situated close to these bags and can be found close to the center of the frame. 


In the background, an airplane  is faintly visible in the distance. 


A couch and multiple benches are also present in the room, adding to the impression of a mall-like setting. 


By examining the depth values and confidence scores, we can identify the distance and distance between certain objects. People can be seen but their confidence scores are relatively low, suggesting some uncertainty.

The floor is covered in beige tiles, giving it an aesthetic appeal. The room appears to be a common area adjacent to an elevator where people gather to socialize, dine, or relax.
